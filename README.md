# **Austin Crash Risk Prediction — Advanced ML Project (UT MSBA)**

This repository contains the full implementation of our Advanced Machine Learning final project, focused on modeling the **probability and expected cost of traffic accidents across Austin, Texas**.  
Using spatiotemporal engineering, weather enrichment, LightGBM, Hurdle modeling, and XGBoost, we built a data pipeline and predictive system capable of identifying high-risk areas and times with strong interpretability and performance.

This project was completed as part of **MIS 382N — Advanced Machine Learning** in the MSBA program at The University of Texas at Austin.

## **Project Motivation**

Austin’s rapid population growth and increasingly congested road network have created a pressing need for **data-driven accident risk forecasting**.

City data shows:

- An accident occurs every **57 seconds**
- Injury or fatal crashes place significant strain on emergency services
- Estimated **$35M+** annual taxpayer burden from motor-vehicle crashes

Identifying **when** and **where** crashes are most likely enables:  
- Smarter resource allocation  
- Infrastructure planning  
- Insurance and dynamic pricing applications  
- Safer route planning for rideshare and logistics

## **Methodology Overview**

This project approaches crash prediction as a **spatiotemporal modeling problem**, integrating:

### **1️⃣ Data Engineering**
- Cleaning and standardizing Austin Open Data crash reports  
- Spatial binning using **H3 hexagonal indexes (resolution 8)**  
- Hourly temporal binning  
- Integrating **hourly weather data**  
- Lag features, weekend/holiday indicators, contextual variables  
- Generating **model-ready panels**  

### **2️⃣ Modeling Approach**
We model **crash probability** and **expected crash cost** using:

#### ✔ **Binary LightGBM**
Predicts whether a crash occurs in a given hex–time combination.

#### ✔ **Hurdle Model**
Two-stage approach:
- **Stage 1:** Probability of crash occurrence (binary LightGBM)  
- **Stage 2:** Expected cost conditional on a crash (regression)

#### ✔ **XGBoost (Tweedie / Regression)**
Used for comparison and capturing nonlinear patterns.

### **3️⃣ Evaluation**
- ROC-AUC, PR-AUC for occurrence modeling  
- Poisson deviance and RMSE for cost modeling  
- Calibration plots  
- SHAP feature importance  
- Out-of-time validation

## **Key Features Engineered**

- **Spatial:** H3 hex cell, road type grouping  
- **Temporal:** hour-of-day, weekday, weekend, monthly seasonality  
- **Weather:** precipitation, temperature  
- **Lag features:** prior crash counts, recency indicators  
- **Context:** speed limits, location grouping  

Together, these form the basis of a **spatiotemporal risk surface** for Austin.
